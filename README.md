# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


ENTER A LABEL IN THE TEXTBOX AND THEN CLICK CAPTURE TO CAPTURE A SPECIFIC SIGN
TRAIN MODEL WHEN YOU HAVE 30+ EXAMPLES OF EACH SIGN CAPTURED
WORKS BEST WITH GOOD LIGHTING + HAND HELD IN SAME GENERAL AREA + USING ONE HAND

HAVE TO TRAIN MODEL EVERY TIME ON RELOAD
ONLY TESTED WITH 2 CLASSES, BUT SHOULD PERFORM WELL WITH MORE
ONLY WORKS FOR ALPHABET AND DEFINITELY NO MOVING SIGNS
YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK FOR NON ALPHABET IF YOU MAKE A LIST OF TERMS AND HAVE IT GIVE AN INDEX THAT CORRESPONDS TO A TERM

Happy Hacking :)
